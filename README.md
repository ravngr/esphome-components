# esphome-components
Custom components for [esphome](https://esphome.io/). I've tried my best to stick to the code style and structure of the esphome project but this whole thing is basically a [ymmv](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ymmv) situation. I'm sharing these components because they are useful to me and might provide some hints to getting other components working or well structured.

## Yale Smart Door Lock
`components/yale` implements a custom lock component that can interact with a Yale smart lock by emulating a "smart" module.
